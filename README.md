# AndroidVideoPlayer
This is sample project [From Exoplayer demo](https://google.github.io/ExoPlayer/demo-application.html).

you can download and test it to your device and emulator.

You need to see these files for understanding :

 - Layout : test_player.xml
 - TestPlayerActivity
 - TestPlayerController
 
I've tested it and play video .mp4 file over HTTP.
